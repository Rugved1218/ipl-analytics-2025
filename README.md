## 🚀 Future Roadmap

This project will evolve into an interactive and intelligent cricket analytics platform that showcases full-stack software development, cloud skills, and applied AI/ML.

### 🔄 Phase 1: Python & Pandas
- Convert `.csv` to Pandas DataFrames
- Team-wise filtering, sorting, grouping
- Top 5 batters/bowlers per team based on metrics
- Modular helper functions (`utils.py`)

### 📊 Phase 2: Data Visualization
- Use Matplotlib/Seaborn to create:
  - Bar/pie/line charts for performance analysis
  - Dynamic comparison graphs
- Save charts or render via Streamlit

### 🧑‍💻 Phase 3: Software Development Layer
- **Player Comparison App**: UI to compare 2 players side-by-side
- **Team Builder Simulator**: Pick a team under a budget, role balance checker
- **Match Simulator**: Rule-based engine simulating games with metrics
- Clean architecture: reusable code, utility scripts, comments, and classes

### 🌐 Phase 4: Deployment & Cloud Skills
- Deploy full dashboard using **Streamlit**, **Flask**, or **FastAPI**
- Host on **Render**, **Railway**, or **AWS/GCP**
- Add version control, logging, and responsiveness

### 🔐 Phase 5: Cybersecurity Demonstration
- Secure form inputs and backend logic
- Token-authenticated API endpoints
- Safe file uploads and user access controls (simulated)

### 🤖 Phase 6: AI/ML Integration
- Player clustering (K-Means): aggressive vs stable
- Score prediction using Regression
- Match outcome simulations using probabilistic models
